This is not a popular opinion, however this is how I see it.

Putin will not give up Crimea even over his dead body. And rightly so. 

Ukraine govt is being reckless here (for reasons unknown) and jeopardizing it more for not only their ppl but entire world. 

- Ask for joining EU WITHOUT joining NATO. 

- Go back and fulfill Minsk II Protocol and grant free and fair local election to autonomous region of Donbas 

- Have an independent and Soverign Ukraine. 

The last will automatically come if above two gets done. And I can tell you these would get accepted by Putin also if not readily but with some good negotiations. 

That’s it. That’s all Ukraine should ask for. The best thing for them as a country. 

Nothing more. Nothing less.
