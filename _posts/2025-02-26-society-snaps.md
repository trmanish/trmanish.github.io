As Silicon Valley leads the orchestra on blowing the trumpet of Technology Acceleration, Society will reach a point where it will just Snap. For the eventuality. 

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #fcfcfc; border: 1px solid #eee; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;">
    <strong>Technology and harmony in society are inversely related. More the drumbeat on technological push, more detached society becomes of humanity.</strong>
</div>


Technology cocoons the generation of people within their own confines. And if that technology push spans multi- generation, you have literally pushed almost the entire population into being a walking zombie where the very basic essence of what it means to be human gets obliterated and lost.

This becomes a huge boon for Capitalism but a disaster for society. Capitalism while helps grow the nation, it hollows out the sense of belonging in society. A typical corporate structure in Capitalism had already made ppl lose value , purpose and sense in their jobs. 

Now, they start to cross the chasm where many realize that the Thing they have been chasing, is most likely not the Thing. 

That’s why ppl have money, yet very few are happy. They have smiles, but they don’t have joy. 

The more you push technology on to society, the more people withdraw from each other. Marriages gets delayed as everyone (both men and women) are chasing their mythical career and person they want to be. It also disbalances the harmony of what two gender in society meant to be. 

There used to be a surreal beauty in accepting our differences as individuals. Women and men were supposed to be two hinge points on which the entire society would run. Two pillars, different, yet form a symbiotic relationship to jointly prop the society. 

There was no shame in accepting our limitations. Women and Men weren’t meant to be Equal. They were meant to be two different individuals each with their own strengths and weaknesses jointly complementing each other.

But Technology starts to blur that distinction. 

As technology starts penetrating more into society , it leads to more ppl getting detached of human connection and more influenced by flimsy hedonistic connections driven by over inflated expectations and misplaced notion of Equality. 80% of Men start chasing 5% of women and 80% of women are chasing 5% of Men. 

When you can easily swipe left or right on thousands of ppl instead of making an effort to meet and ask them out, you trivialize the essence of what relationships is based on. 

Leads to marriages being pushed out, families not getting formed. Babies not being born. 

From a nuclear family, everyone starts living alone. Providing only for themselves instead of looking to provide for others which is where the meaning would come in our pursuits. 

With that meaning gone, the pursuits have just become purposeless chase. In the echoing silence of our solitary pursuits, we are focusing on amassing fortunes, yet it’s in the warmth of shared generosity that we find the true wealth of inner happiness that has gone amiss. 

And then suddenly, one day, the whole Society snaps!
