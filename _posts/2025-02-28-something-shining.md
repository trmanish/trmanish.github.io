I have thought a while if I should share this. Since the gravity and importance of what I share below, is completely dependent upon on how my Mental Model of things are. Yours could be different. 

However, if my Mental Model is right, then this is the most important thing you will ever read in your life going forward!. Young, old, rich or poor. Irrespective of whichever country you are living and what job you do. 

Don't DM me asking on this. Am fine sharing if I talk to anyone in person. But won't do that elsewhere.

Read it! You might probably end up thanking me later in life!
