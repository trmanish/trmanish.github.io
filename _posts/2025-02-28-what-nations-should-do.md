What Nations Should Do: 

- Economic Activity is merely Energy Transformed. More Energy at disposal in Society, more Productive & Innovation growth of the Society. Reason behind all technology, medical and science innovation last 200 years. 

- The only path for Surplus Energy Disposal is moving UP the Energy Density of fuel and NOT down. 

- While it might appear fossil fuel provide 80% of our energy needs in society (down a mere 3-4% in 50 years), the actual reality is fossil fuels contribute (in some form) 100% of every product and service you use in Life from the moment you get born until death. 

- This means the ONLY path going forward for our industrialized society is Fossil Fuels + Nuclear (highest energy density fuel). 

- Abandon poor energy density ,expensive and unreliable energy source in Solar and Wind Farms. Individual residential level is NOT the same as a society. Pull the plug on the FARMS immediately. No joke. 

- Invest immediatey in drilling, fracking for near future while planning for large scale Nuclear Reactors for clean true sustainable energy as a long term mission. Countries which understand this are already on it (China and to some extent India). 

- Ban BEVs and roll back all subsidies. BEVs cause more net emission (production + driving) than gas cars. Do your work to understand truth including reading IEA’s own study and the associated assumptions in DETAIL. 

- Mandate Hybrid vehicles - the real best solution to have minimal carbon emissions

- Govts should work with Universities and industry to provide free/subsidized vocational programs to re-skill their nation towards skills of future - Real Eng, Science, Biology, Nuclear Engineering. 

- Do not provide UBI. UBI is inherenty anti-ambition. The drive to make money is most often an important criteria fueling ppl’s ambition as very few actually find their purpose. Provide free easy money to society and 2nd Order Effect of less ambitious drive in ppl takes over. Bad for society. 

- Mandate every kid graduating high school/college in a country to spend some time in a different culture by govts partnering together on a short term exchange vocation program. The best way to build empathy in societies towards each other. 

- Outlaw Social Media apps for teenagers until the age of 17-18. 

- Provide economic rewards as incentive to nuclear families. The biggest privilege in life is not the color of one’s skin. It’s born in a family where both parents take accountability of a kid’s education.

- Mandate one month stay with Old people post graduating high school. Best way to teach Life and Regrets!

- Penalize people with the biggest “online bugle” for pushing concerted false narratives.
