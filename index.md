<div class="italic-text">
  <p>When You take a Statistics view, You see your life is a Markov Chain. It tells you, your present is based on your recent past and not distant past. And your near future is based on your present. However, distant future has no connection to where you are right now in life.</p>
  <p>However, when you take the Physics view, you learn your Life is like a movie pre-recorded in a DVD handed to you to watch it one frame at a time without a remote control. Everything that has to happen, has already happened. And everything that you think is going to happen is already recorded even before you got born. There is no Past, no Present and no Future. Past, Present and Future all exists together because the very essence of Life- Time, is just an Illusion.</p>
  <p>So every moment you end up worrying about future, every moment you regret about your Life, is all just a mirage when you realize, that everything, every event, every moment, you will ever create in this Universe, has already been created. All you are made to do is watch it unfold one by one from your view. While there is someone, somewhere in Universe, who can watch all the "future" events of your lives unfold even before they happen to you. </p>
  <p>Life is static. It doesn't unfold or move. It's a constant. It's just us who feel it change.</p>
