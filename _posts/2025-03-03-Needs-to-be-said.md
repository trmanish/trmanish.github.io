1. The ‘Artificial’ in Artificial Intelligence is for a reason. Because it’s fake. AI is dumber than a rodent and AI won’t be smarter than humans. 

2. Rich ppl want you to think twice about using fossil fuel to prepare food as it will drown the entire planet while flying themselves in private jet to their multiple Oceanside mansions. 

3. Fossil fuels feed billions every day. This is what sustains life on planet. You can take away the civilization, but you can’t take away fossil fuel. 

4. A non-biological female has no right to participate in female sports. Sports is a physical endeavor. Not a virtue signaling one. 

5. Technology and Critical Thinking are inversely related. More the technology adoption, dumber the society. 

6. Humans teach machine to learn from mistakes made on historical data. But humans never learn from mistakes made in their history. 

7. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me always, is a crowd. 

8. It’s easier to fool someone than to convince them that they have been fooled. 

9. Socialism appears to create Equality for all. But it takes away your liberty. 

10. Problem in world is because people care more about their Reputation than their Character. Character is what you really are. Reputation is merely what you want others to know who you are. 

11. Everyone wants to go out on a Date with Data, but hardly few want to marry. Faith triumphs Facts for humans. 

12. Artificial Intelligence is not a threat to Humanity. Natural Stupidity is. 

13. Virtue Signaling ,Wokeism & Extreme Conservatism are the most expensive commodities in life. Because they cost lives. 

15. Life is not Left. Life is not Right. Life is somewhere in Between. 

14. The problem with Social Networks has always been the Social (the people) and not the Network (the company). We like creating and spreading misinformation. 

15. Electric Vehicles do not help in saving planet. Drive a Used Car, or a Hybrid if you really care. 

16. Men and Women should figure out what is good for their body. Not the State. 

17. The more someone talks about shortsellers and their stock, the more dead bodies they are trying to hide. 

18. People want an “authority” to tell them what to think. But that Authority is not someone who is an Authority on Facts. It’s someone who just appears “authoritative” 

19. There is no Wisdom in the Crowd, if the Crowd does not have Wisdom in most people. 

20. Truth is always the daughter of Time. Not of Authority. Not of the crowd.
