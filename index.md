  <p>When I take a Statistics view, I see Our life is a Markov Chain. It tells you, your present is based on your recent past and not distant past. And your near future is based on your present. But distant future has no connection to where you are right now in life.</p>
  <p>However, when you take the Physics view, you learn Our Life is like a movie pre-recorded in a DVD handed to us to watch it one frame at a time without any remote control. Everything that has to happen, has already happened. And everything that we think is going to happen is already recorded even before we got born. There is no Past, no Present and no Future. Past, Present and Future all exists together because the very essence of Life- Time, is just an Illusion.</p>
  <p>So every moment you end up worrying about future, every moment we regret about our Life, is all just a mirage when you realize, that everything, every event, every moment, you will ever create in this Universe, has already been created. All we are made to do is watch it unfold one by one from our view. While there is someone, somewhere in Universe, who can watch all the "future" events of our lives unfold even before they happen to us. </p>
  <p>Life is static. It doesn't unfold or move. It's a constant. It's just us who feel it change.</p>
