# **On Loneliness and Depression**<br><br>

*First Published in March, 2020 on LI* <br><br>


As you observe more, you realize: 

- When someone overshares more, it’s usually a symptom of loneliness. While it comes from a person with openness, it’s mind’s desperate desire for connection, an intimacy. A need to have someone to talk to. 

The person oversharing tries to do that by short circuiting the process and expedite the friendship with whom they just started talking and met. 

- There is a very thin line between Introspection and Rumination. Introspection leads to self awareness. Rumination leads to Self Obsession and Depression. 

Depression is a symptom when one gets deeply into self rumination and thinking and talking about their problems. The more you talk about yourself and your problems, the more you will get sucked into Depression. 

Reason why Therapies are not where you cure your depression. But flame it. As therapy makes you talk about YOU! Makes you ruminate about your self, your problems. 

The cure to depression is stop ruminating. 

Stop thinking and Start doing. 

Do just about anything. Go out in the world and do something. Pick a shovel and dig out sand from the beach and throw it on one side. Pick it back up and fill it again.

    <strong>Human Mind works well if it’s busy doing something. The joy of its labor is seeing a creation. An activity.

It starts to rot when it’s just doing thinking.
